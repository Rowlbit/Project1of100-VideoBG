<!-- Notes of things I learned from this project 

1. I can also type doc instead of ! or !!! which will autofill the code from starting HTML tags to meta to body to ending HTML. 
   It does not however add the DOCTYPE tage so I will need to manually input that tag on my own. 

2. I can also press tab afterwards to cycle through the highlighted words instead of highlighting and trying to do what I want to 
accomplished.  

3. Pexel website is where I can go to download free videos. 

4. I can expand - collapse tags such as head and etc. 

5. You can have src inside a tag, but you can also use a source tag instead. Example would be line 19. 

6. Do not keep the type= on the source tag. It messes with the video. 

7. Put in the various commands in the video tag such as autoplay, loop, muted, and plays-line. 

8. The Section tag defines a section in a document.
