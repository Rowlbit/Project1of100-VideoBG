| In order to work on both coding and refresh my knowledge on web development, I decided to create 100 projects that will be both practice and portfolio-worthy.*

Project 1 is a video background project. A video is used as a background, and is what is seen on some websites such as ivs.tv The estimated time for completion was about 20 minutes minimum.

The video used was provided by Yaroslav Shuraev and can be accessed through the following link: https://www.pexels.com/video/drone-flying-over-the-mountain-peak-4763824
The things that I learned are in the comments that is on the bottom of each file. I will potentially add more comments over the time in their respective files.
